/**
 * The persistence of the workflow aggregate, written by the application. The second of the four
 * beans, and the one VanillaBP cannot do without: it has to save the aggregate when a workflow
 * starts, load it before a {@code @WorkflowTask} method and save it afterwards.
 *
 * <p>
 * A map stands in for the real thing here. In an application this is an event store, a ledger, a
 * message producer or a service behind an API - anything the platform does not manage, which is
 * why this interface exists at all. The methods are the whole contract, and every one of them is
 * needed for a reason:
 * </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code getAggregateClass} selects this implementation for that aggregate. The most
 * specific implementation wins, so one class may serve a whole family through a shared
 * interface.</li>
 * <li>{@code save} and {@code loadById} are what VanillaBP calls, always inside the unit of work
 * it opened through {@link UnitOfWork}.</li>
 * <li>{@code getAggregateId} is the identity of the business case, used as the workflow's
 * business key.</li>
 * <li>{@code getAggregateIdName} is needed by an adapter which stores the id in the BPMS itself,
 * naming a process variable after the id property. Camunda 8 does, so leaving it out would fail
 * while a workflow is started - with a message saying exactly that.</li>
 * <li>{@code getAggregateIdType} lets VanillaBP validate at startup that the id survives the
 * outbox, where it is kept as text.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>The store enlists in the unit of work</strong>, and that is the part which is easy to
 * get wrong: a write goes into a buffer of the running unit of work first and into the store
 * itself when that unit of work commits. Writing straight into the map would make the aggregate
 * of an aborted business case visible, and VanillaBP's promise that a workflow and its aggregate
 * cannot exist without each other would be void. A durable store enlists in whatever its
 * technology offers instead of copying this buffer.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Copies go in and out on purpose: a store which handed out its own instances would let a caller
 * change what is stored without saving.
 * </p>
