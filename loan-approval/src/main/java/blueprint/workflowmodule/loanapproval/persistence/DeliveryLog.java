/**
 * What this application remembers about tasks the BPMS delivered, and the fourth of the four
 * beans.
 *
 * <p>
 * A remote BPMS may hand the same task over twice - after a timeout, after a restart, after a
 * lost answer. VanillaBP records what it processed and answers a repeated delivery from that
 * record instead of running the handler a second time. Without this store there is nothing to
 * answer from, and the application starts with a message saying so.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The record is written inside the same unit of work as everything else the task did, which is
 * what makes it truthful: work which was rolled back must not leave a record behind, or the
 * repetition that would have fixed it is skipped. Here that comes for free, because
 * {@code UnitOfWork} rolls back a map operation by never having made it visible - a durable
 * store has to arrange it, and VanillaBP's own ones do.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Keeping records forever is not the intention either. A durable store deletes them after a
 * retention period which outlives the deliveries a BPMS may repeat.
 * </p>
