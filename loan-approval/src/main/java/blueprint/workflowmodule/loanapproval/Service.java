/**
 * The business service of this use case: what the application can do with a loan approval,
 * expressed without a single word about processes.
 *
 * <p>
 * It never touches VanillaBP. Whenever the business case moves on, it tells {@link Workflow}
 * what happened, {@code loanRequested} rather than "start the process", and that class
 * decides what this means for the BPMN. The other direction runs through
 * {@link WorkflowTaskHandler}, which calls the methods below when the process reaches a
 * task.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Both directions meet here, and that is the point: this is the one class describing the
 * use case, and it does so without naming a single BPMN element.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Where the other blueprints put {@code @Transactional}, this one opens the unit of work
 * itself. An annotation of the platform would start a transaction the store of this
 * application is not part of, and VanillaBP would refuse the workflow start because the unit
 * of work it asks about is not open. So the method the API calls brackets its work with
 * {@link UnitOfWork}, and that bracket is what the aggregate and the outbox entry ride.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The methods a task handler calls bracket nothing, exactly as everywhere else: VanillaBP has
 * already opened the unit of work for the task, and it commits it for a {@code TaskException}
 * on purpose so the process can react to what the handler wrote.
 * </p>
