# persistence-custom

The application brings its own persistence: the workflow aggregate, the phase-two outbox, the
log of delivered tasks and the unit of work bracketing all three. No database anywhere, the
stores are maps. A delta on top of `module-single`, changing nothing but the persistence.

## Placeholders

Replace all of these consistently; they are the same in every blueprint.

| `loan_approval`            | BPMN process ID                                                                                                           |

Blueprint-specific names, each occurring in more than one place:

|      Name       |                                             Where it occurs                                              |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `UnitOfWork`    | the transaction of the application; injected by `Service` and by all three stores                        |
| `loanRequestId` | the id property, returned by `AggregateStore#getAggregateIdName` because a remote BPMS asks for its name |

**The rule this blueprint is built on:** VanillaBP puts everything it does around one aggregate
into one transaction. Where the platform does not manage the persistence, the application says
what that transaction is and every store of the application enlists in it. A store which writes
straight into its data structure looks correct until the first rollback.

`WorkflowModuleTest`, `TestApplication` and `ApplicationSmokeTest` are identical in every
blueprint - copy them unchanged. Note that the integration test polls the aggregate through a
function here, which is the overload of the base class made for a store that is not a repository.

## Adding this blueprint to an existing project

1. Build `module-single` first, or apply this to an existing workflow module. Everything except
   the persistence is that blueprint unchanged.
2. Only take this route if the persistence is really not one the platform serves. A repository is
   less code and less to get wrong; `persistence-mongodb` shows that case.
3. Write the unit of work first (`TransactionRunner`). Without it VanillaBP has nothing to
   bracket its work with, and on a platform without a transaction manager the application does
   not even boot. Implement `requireNew`, `inCurrent`, `requireTransaction` and
   `isTransactionActive` honestly: the last one is what a workflow start is refused by when the
   caller opened nothing. Contribute it as a plain bean for the whole application, or as a
   `TransactionRunnerAware` bean per aggregate when several persistences exist side by side.
4. Write `AggregatePersistenceAware`. The methods left unimplemented throw with a message naming
   what VanillaBP wanted to do, so start with `getAggregateClass`, `save`, `loadById` and
   `getAggregateId` and add `getAggregateIdName` as soon as a remote BPMS is used - it names the
   process variable the id is stored in. Return copies rather than the stored instances.
5. Write `PhaseTwoOutbox` and `TaskDeliveryLog`. Both are required for a remote BPMS: without the
   outbox the boot fails naming it, without the delivery log a repeated delivery runs the handler
   twice. Dispatch an entry by asking `PhaseTwoOperationRegistry` for the operation of its name -
   never interpret an entry.
6. Enlist every store in the unit of work: collect what a unit of work writes, apply it in
   `afterCommit`, throw it away in `afterRollback`. In a real store this is whatever its
   technology offers instead. A delivery record for work which was rolled back is the worst of
   the three, because the repetition which would have fixed it is answered from the record.
7. Open the unit of work where the application starts something: no `@Transactional` of the
   platform, it would open a transaction your store is not part of. The methods a task handler
   calls open nothing, exactly as in every other blueprint.
8. Read the startup line naming the transaction each aggregate is processed in. It is the check
   that steps 3 and 4 worked, and it names which of the four resolution steps answered.
9. Use a remote BPMS. An embedded engine needs a relational database and invokes handlers inside
   its own transaction, which a store of your own cannot join.

## Verifying

```bash
bin/camunda8_cluster.sh start   # in the monorepo, or bring your own cluster
mvn install verify
```

`camunda8` is the only profile of this blueprint and it is active by default. Nothing else has to
run: the stores are in memory.

All three tests of `LoanApprovalIT` have to pass.
`vanillaBpWorksInsideTheUnitOfWorkOfThisApplication` is the one which cannot be replaced by
looking at the outcome: it counts the units of work, and a workflow which works while something
else commits looks exactly the same. `aFailedStartLeavesNothingBehind` fails when a store writes
without enlisting. `ApplicationSmokeTest` passing means the application boots with the module on
the classpath.

Do not report success without having run this.
